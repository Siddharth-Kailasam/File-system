Block size -
Physical size - 2kB so as to save wastage of blocks
Logical size - 1 byte (Hence byte addressable)

Size of superblock - 6 bytes
1 byte each for magic number (file type),3 bytes for number of blocks, 1 for number of inode blocks,1 for n inodes each including 1 indirect pointer.

bitmap - 1 bit for each physical block. Hence, 4 bytes required.

n-ary trees for inodes in files
